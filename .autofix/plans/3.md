# Issue 3: Documentation mismatch - missing --env-file in provision.md

## What the issue is and where

`libs/mngr/docs/commands/secondary/provision.md` does not document the `--env-file` option,
even though the CLI implements it (as `--env-file` / `--agent-env-file`). The `create.md` docs
do document this option.

## Why it is a problem

Users reading the documentation will not know about the `--env-file` option for the provision
command, even though it is available and functional.

## Planned fix

Add `--env-file FILE` to the "Simple configuration" section of provision.md, consistent with
how it appears in create.md.

## Risks

None. This is a straightforward documentation addition.
