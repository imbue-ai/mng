# Issue 3: Integration test file in wrong directory

## What the issue is and where

`libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/test_schedule.py` contains integration tests for the
schedule CLI command but is located in the `imbue/mngr/` directory.

## Why it is a problem

All other CLI command integration tests are in `imbue/mngr/cli/`:
- test_clone.py
- test_config.py
- test_connect.py
- test_create.py
- test_destroy.py
- test_gc.py
- test_list.py
- etc.

The schedule integration test file breaks this organizational pattern.

## Planned fix

Move `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/test_schedule.py` to
`libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/test_schedule.py`.

## Risks

None -- the file content doesn't need to change, just the location.
