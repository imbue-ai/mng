# Issue 3: Duplicated host reference building logic

## What and Where
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/limit.py`:
- `_resolve_host_identifiers` (lines 173-186) builds a list of HostReference from list_agents results
- `_apply_host_only_changes` (lines 492-505) contains the same logic

## Why It's a Problem
Repetitive/duplicate code: both functions iterate over list_agents results and build HostReference objects in exactly the same way. This violates DRY and makes maintenance harder.

## Planned Fix
Extract a shared `_build_host_references` helper function that takes a MngrContext, calls list_agents, and returns the list of HostReference objects. Both callers will use this shared helper.

## Risks
None -- straightforward extraction of duplicated code.
