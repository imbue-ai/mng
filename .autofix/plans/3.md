# Issue 3: time.sleep usage in open_agent_url

## What the issue is and where
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/open.py` line 50-51, the wait loop uses `time.sleep(1.0)`:
```python
while not stop_event.is_set():
    time.sleep(1.0)
```

## Why it is a problem
1. The style guide says: "NEVER use time.sleep() (either in tests, or in the actual code)"
2. The ratchet test `test_prevent_time_sleep` allows at most 1 occurrence of `time.sleep`.
   The existing codebase has 1 (in `utils/polling.py`). Adding another in `api/open.py`
   will cause the ratchet test to fail.

## The planned fix
Replace the `time.sleep(1.0)` + `stop_event.is_set()` loop with just
`stop_event.wait(timeout=1.0)`, which is functionally equivalent (blocks
for up to 1 second, or returns immediately if the event is set) and does
not use `time.sleep`. This also removes the `import time` since `time`
is no longer needed.

The test that monkeypatches `time.sleep` will need to be updated to
instead set the stop_event after a brief delay, since the wait loop
will use `stop_event.wait()` instead.

## Risks or edge cases
`stop_event.wait(timeout)` returns True if the event was set, False if
it timed out. The existing `while not stop_event.is_set()` check is
equivalent to `while not stop_event.wait(timeout=1.0)`. The behavior
under KeyboardInterrupt is the same since the interrupt is caught in
the same try/except block.
