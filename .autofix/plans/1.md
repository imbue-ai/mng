# Issue 1: Duplicated _format_size function

## What
The `_format_size` function in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/snapshot.py` (lines 156-167) is an exact duplicate of the `_format_size` function in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/gc.py` (lines 450-460). Both functions format byte counts into human-readable size strings with identical logic.

## Why it is a problem
Duplicated utility code means any bug fix or enhancement must be applied in both places. This violates DRY and the style guide guidance to reuse existing code. The tests for `_format_size` are also duplicated in `snapshot_test.py` (lines 124-141), repeating what is already covered by `gc_test.py`.

## Planned fix
1. Move `_format_size` from `gc.py` to `output_helpers.py` (a shared CLI utility module) and rename it to `format_size` (public, since it will be imported by both modules).
2. Update `gc.py` to import from `output_helpers.py` instead of defining it locally.
3. Update `snapshot.py` to import from `output_helpers.py` instead of defining it locally.
4. Update `gc_test.py` to import from `output_helpers.py`.
5. Remove the duplicate `_format_size` tests from `snapshot_test.py` (they already exist in `gc_test.py`).
6. Update `snapshot_test.py` imports to point to the new location.

## Risks
- Need to check if `output_helpers.py` is the right location or if there's a better shared utils module.
- Need to verify that import layering is maintained.
