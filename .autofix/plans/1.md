# Issue 1: Host filtering logic error when --host combined with agent targeting

## What and Where
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/limit.py` lines 376-378, when `--host` is combined with `--all` or specific agent names, the code filters agents by comparing `str(a.host_id)` against the raw user input from `opts.hosts`. But the user may provide a host *name* (e.g., "my-host") rather than a host ID (e.g., "host-abc123..."), which means the filter would never match.

## Why It's a Problem
This is a logic error. If a user runs `mngr limit --all --host my-host-name --idle-timeout 300`, the host filtering would fail to match any agents because `str(a.host_id)` is a UUID-like string (e.g., "host-abc123...") that won't equal the user's host name string.

The `_apply_host_only_changes` code path correctly uses `resolve_host_reference` to handle both IDs and names, but the agent+host code path does not.

## Planned Fix
Resolve each host reference from `opts.hosts` to get the actual `HostId` values, then filter agents by those resolved host IDs. This requires:
1. Building a host list (like `_apply_host_only_changes` does)
2. Resolving each host identifier to a `HostReference`
3. Filtering agents by the resolved host IDs

Alternatively, we can also compare against both host_id and host_name from the agent data. But the cleanest approach is to resolve host references first and then filter by host_id, which is consistent with how `_apply_host_only_changes` works.

Since we already have `AgentMatch` objects with `host_id` in them, and the `list_agents` call has already been made by `find_agents_by_identifiers_or_state`, we need to resolve the host identifiers. We can build the host references from the agent matches themselves and then resolve.

## Risks
- Need to handle the case where a host identifier doesn't match any known host (should raise UserInputError)
- Need to ensure the same list_agents data is used for both agent finding and host resolution
