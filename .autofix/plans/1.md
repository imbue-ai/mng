# Issue 1: Remove @pure from _emit_template_output

## What the issue is and where

The function `_emit_template_output` at line 742 of `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/list.py` is decorated with `@pure`, but it writes to `sys.stdout` (I/O side effect). The `@pure` decorator indicates a function has no side effects and performs no I/O operations.

## Why it is a problem

The `@pure` annotation is advisory documentation that signals to readers that the function is side-effect-free. Marking an I/O function as `@pure` is misleading. All other `_emit_*` functions in the same file (`_emit_json_output`, `_emit_jsonl_agent`, `_emit_jsonl_error`, `_emit_human_output`) correctly lack the `@pure` decorator.

## The planned fix

Remove the `@pure` decorator from `_emit_template_output`.

## Risks or edge cases

None -- the decorator is advisory only and does not affect runtime behavior.
