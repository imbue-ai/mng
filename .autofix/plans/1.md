# Issue 1: Remove .autofix/plans/ files from branch

## What the issue is and where

The files `.autofix/plans/1.md` and `.autofix/plans/2.md` are committed to the branch. These files are artifacts from a previous autofix verification run and describe issues that have already been fixed (the `@pure` removal and the integration test addition).

## Why it is a problem

These plan files are process artifacts, not part of the feature implementation. They have never been merged to main and would add noise to the diff. The `.autofix/plans/` directory is intended as a working area for the autofix process, not as permanent checked-in content.

## The planned fix

Remove the old plan files from git tracking using `git rm`.

## Risks or edge cases

None -- these files are purely documentary and removing them does not affect any functionality.
