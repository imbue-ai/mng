# Issue 1: Duplicate _resolve_env_vars function

## What the issue is and where

`_resolve_env_vars` in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/provision.py` (lines 49-67) is a near-exact copy of `_resolve_env_vars` in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/create.py` (lines 1045-1065).

## Why it is a problem

Code duplication makes maintenance harder. If the env var resolution logic needs to change, both copies would need to be updated independently, risking divergence.

## Planned fix

1. Move the function to `cli/env_utils.py` as a non-private function `resolve_env_vars`.
2. Update both `cli/provision.py` and `cli/create.py` to import from `cli/env_utils.py`.

Wait -- checking the layered import structure and existing patterns. The function is already in the CLI layer.
Looking at existing shared utilities, `cli/common_opts.py` and `cli/agent_utils.py` already exist.
Better to put it in a file that already exists for shared CLI utilities. `cli/agent_utils.py` is for agent-specific utils. The env var resolution is more general.

Actually, looking more carefully, this is a simple utility used only by CLI commands. I'll create `cli/env_utils.py` as a new shared file.

But wait -- the style guide says private functions should be prefixed with `_`. Since this will now be imported by other files, it should be public: `resolve_env_vars`.

## Risks

None significant. The function is pure and only used in CLI commands.
