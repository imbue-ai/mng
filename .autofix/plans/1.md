# Issue 1: Missing exec command in docs generation and missing docs file

## What the issue is and where

The `exec` command was added to `BUILTIN_COMMANDS` in `main.py` and registered with help metadata, but:
1. `scripts/make_cli_docs.py` line 24: `PRIMARY_COMMANDS` set does not include `"exec"`
2. `libs/mngr/docs/commands/primary/exec.md` does not exist
3. `libs/mngr/README.md` links to `docs/commands/primary/exec.md` which does not exist

## Why it is a problem

Every other primary command (connect, create, destroy, list, pair, pull, push, start, stop) has a corresponding entry in `PRIMARY_COMMANDS` and a generated docs file. Without adding `exec` to this set, the docs generation script will skip it, and the README link will be broken.

## Planned fix

1. Add `"exec"` to the `PRIMARY_COMMANDS` set in `scripts/make_cli_docs.py`
2. Run `uv run python scripts/make_cli_docs.py` to generate the missing docs file

## Risks or edge cases

None significant. The docs generation script already handles new commands correctly; we just need to register it.
