# Issue 1: Missing Final type annotation on constant

## What the issue is and where
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/open.py` line 12, the constant `_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` is declared as:
```python
_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 30.0
```

## Why it is a problem
The style guide requires all constants to be declared with `Final`:
> Always declare constants to be `Final`

Other constants in the same codebase follow this pattern (e.g., `_GIT_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: Final[float] = 30.0` in `api/pair.py`).

## The planned fix
Add `from typing import Final` import and change the declaration to:
```python
_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_SECONDS: Final[float] = 30.0
```

## Risks or edge cases
None. This is a purely additive type annotation change.
