# Issue 1: Missing @pure decorator on _extract_text_delta

## What the issue is and where

The function `_extract_text_delta` in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/ask.py` (line 62) is a pure function (takes a string input, returns a string or None, with no side effects or global state access) but is missing the `@pure` decorator.

## Why it is a problem

The style guide states: "Almost all functions should be pure (have no side-effects)" and "All pure functions should be marked with the @pure decorator from imbue_common." Other CLI files in the codebase (e.g., `gc.py`) consistently use `@pure` on their helper functions that are pure. This is a documentation/implementation mismatch with the style guide.

## Planned fix

1. Add `from imbue.imbue_common.pure import pure` to the imports in `ask.py`
2. Add the `@pure` decorator to `_extract_text_delta`

## Risks or edge cases

None. The `@pure` decorator is advisory only and does not change runtime behavior.
