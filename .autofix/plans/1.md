# Issue 1: Incorrect shell redirect order in _build_crontab_command

## What the issue is and where

In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/schedule.py`, line 138, the crontab command uses
`2>&1 >> {log_path}`, which is incorrect shell redirect ordering.

## Why it is a problem

In shell, `2>&1 >> file` means:
1. Redirect stderr (fd 2) to wherever stdout (fd 1) currently points (the terminal or cron mail)
2. Then redirect stdout (fd 1) to the file

This results in only stdout being captured to the log file, while stderr goes to
the terminal/cron mail. The correct order is `>> file 2>&1`, which:
1. First redirects stdout to the file
2. Then redirects stderr to wherever stdout now points (the file)

## Planned fix

Change `2>&1 >> {log_path}` to `>> {log_path} 2>&1` in `_build_crontab_command`.

Also update the test in `schedule_test.py` that checks for the log path pattern.

## Risks

The test `test_build_crontab_command_with_template` checks for
`schedule-hourly-fixer.log` in the output, so we need to verify this still passes.
