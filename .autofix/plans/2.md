# Issue 2: Broad except Exception catch in _record_activity_loop

## What the issue is and where
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/open.py` line 63, the `_record_activity_loop` function
catches `Exception` which is too broad.

## Why it is a problem
1. The style guide says: "Never use a blanket `except:` clause! Always catch the narrowest specific exception type"
2. The ratchet test `test_prevent_broad_exception_catch` allows at most 2 occurrences
   of `except Exception`. The existing codebase has 2 (both in `hosts/host.py`). Adding
   a third in `api/open.py` will cause the ratchet test to fail.

## The planned fix
Replace `except Exception:` with `except (OSError, BaseMngrError):` which covers:
- `OSError` and subclasses (for file I/O failures in `write_text_file`)
- `BaseMngrError` and subclasses like `HostConnectionError` (for host connection errors)

## Risks or edge cases
If `record_activity` raises an unexpected exception type (e.g., a `ValueError` from
serialization), it would propagate and crash the background thread. This is acceptable
since it would indicate a programming error that should be fixed.
