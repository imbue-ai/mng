# Issue 2: Custom _shell_quote reimplements shlex.quote

## What the issue is and where

In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/api/schedule.py`, the `_shell_quote` function
reimplements shell quoting that is already provided by `shlex.quote` from
the Python standard library.

## Why it is a problem

The codebase already uses `shlex.quote` extensively (in host.py, base_agent.py,
connect.py, gc.py, etc.). Having a custom reimplementation is duplicate code
that introduces maintenance burden and potential for divergence.

## Planned fix

1. Replace `_shell_quote` usage with `shlex.quote` in `_build_crontab_command`
2. Remove the `_shell_quote` function
3. Add `import shlex` at the top of the file
4. Update the unit tests to use `shlex.quote` instead of importing `_shell_quote`
5. Remove unit tests that specifically test `_shell_quote` behavior

## Risks

The quoting style differs slightly (`shlex.quote` uses `'"'"'` while
`_shell_quote` uses `'\''`), but both are correct shell quoting. Test assertions
that check for specific quoted output will need to be updated.
