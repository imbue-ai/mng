# Issue 2: Missing arguments_description in exec help metadata

## What the issue is and where

The `_EXEC_HELP_METADATA` in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/exec.py` (lines 168-192) does not
provide an `arguments_description` field. As a result, the auto-generated docs at
`libs/mngr/docs/commands/primary/exec.md` show generic descriptions:

- `AGENT`: The agent
- `COMMAND`: The command arg

These are auto-inferred by `_infer_argument_description` in `scripts/make_cli_docs.py`
and are not very helpful.

## Why it is a problem

Other commands like `create` provide explicit `arguments_description` fields for better
documentation. The exec command's argument descriptions should clearly describe what
AGENT and COMMAND mean.

## Planned fix

1. Add `arguments_description` to `_EXEC_HELP_METADATA` in `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/exec.py`
2. Regenerate the docs by running `uv run python scripts/make_cli_docs.py`

## Risks or edge cases

None significant. The arguments_description field is already supported by the help metadata
system and used by the create command.
