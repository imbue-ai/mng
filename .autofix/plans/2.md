# Issue 2: README still marks `ask` as [future]

## What the issue is and where

In `libs/mngr/README.md` line 166, the `ask` command is listed with the `[future]` tag:
```
- [`ask`](docs/commands/secondary/ask.md) [future]: Chat with mngr for help
```

## Why it is a problem

The `ask` command is now fully implemented (the entire `ask.py` module has been created with a working CLI command, tests, and documentation). The `[future]` tag is misleading and creates a documentation/implementation mismatch.

## Planned fix

Remove the `[future]` tag from the `ask` entry in `libs/mngr/README.md` line 166, changing it to:
```
- [`ask`](docs/commands/secondary/ask.md): Chat with mngr for help
```

## Risks or edge cases

None. This is a simple documentation fix.
