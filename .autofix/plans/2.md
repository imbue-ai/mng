# Issue 2: Variable reassignment in snapshot_list

## What
In `libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/snapshot.py`, the `snapshot_list` function (line 612) reassigns the variable `all_snapshots`:
```python
all_snapshots = all_snapshots[: opts.limit]
```
This variable was first assigned on line 598.

## Why it is a problem
The style guide explicitly states: "Never re-assign to the same function-scoped variable. Instead, create a new variable with an updated name."

## Planned fix
Rename the sliced result to `limited_snapshots` (or use a ternary to avoid the reassignment entirely):
```python
limited_snapshots = all_snapshots[: opts.limit] if opts.limit is not None else all_snapshots
_emit_list_snapshots(limited_snapshots, output_opts)
```

## Risks
None - straightforward rename.
