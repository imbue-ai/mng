# Issue 4: Module-level docstring in snapshot_test.py

## What
`libs/mngr/imbue/mngr/cli/snapshot_test.py` line 1 contains a module-level docstring:
`"""Unit tests for the snapshot CLI command."""`

## Why it is a problem
The style guide explicitly states: "Never create docstrings for modules". This is a new
file added by this branch and should follow the style guide.

## Planned fix
Remove the module-level docstring (line 1) from `snapshot_test.py`.

## Risks
None.
