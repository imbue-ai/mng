This is the primary flow for how a user would deploy a changeling for the first time:

1. User runs: `changeling deploy <git-url>` (optionally with `--repo-sub-path <path>` if the changeling.toml is in a subdirectory)
   The git URL can be a local path, file://, https://, or ssh URL pointing to a repo containing a changeling.toml.
2. (User gets through various auth flows, now has tokens -- just assume this exists for now, we'll set the right env vars)
3. User answers some questions:
   - What do you want to name the agent? [<default from changeling.toml> | <type something>]
   - Where do you want this agent to run? [local | modal | docker]
   - Do you want this agent to be able to launch its own agents? [yes | not now]
   - [future] Do you want to access this agent from anywhere besides this computer? [yes (requires forwarding server) | not now]
   - [future] Do you want to receive mobile notifications from this agent? [yes (requires notification setup) | not now]
4. We run: `git clone <git-url>` to create an isolated copy, then `mng create --name <name> --no-connect` from within the clone directory.
   If the user wants the agent to be able to run its own agents and tasks, we ensure that `mng` is injected as well.
5. We ensure a local forwarding server daemon process is running (for forwarding web requests and handling authentication). One-time auth codes are generated and stored for the new changeling.
6. We're done: print the associated URL where the agent can be accessed (e.g. http://localhost:8420/agents/<agent-id>/)

The point of this whole flow is to make it as easy as possible for users to deploy a new changeling.
