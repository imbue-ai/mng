# mng-schedule

Run AI agents on a schedule.

A plugin for [mng](https://github.com/imbue-ai/mng) that adds the `mng schedule` command for scheduling recurring invocations of `mng` commands (even on remote providers)

## Overview

`mng schedule` lets you set up cron-scheduled triggers that automatically run `mng` commands (create, start, message, exec) at regular intervals. 
This is useful for autonomous agents that should run on a recurring schedule -- for example, a nightly code review agent or a periodic test runner.

## Usage

```bash
# Add a nightly agent that runs at 2am in modal
mng schedule add --command create --args "--type claude --message 'review recent PRs' --in modal" --schedule "0 2 * * *" --provider modal

# Add a named trigger that runs locally
mng schedule add nightly-test-checker --command create --args "--message 'make sure all tests are passing'" --schedule "0 3 * * *" --provider local

# List all active local schedules
mng schedule list --provider local

# List all modal schedules including disabled ones
mng schedule list --provider modal --all

# Update an existing trigger
mng schedule update my-trigger --schedule "0 4 * * *"

# Disable a trigger without removing it
mng schedule update my-trigger --disabled

# Test a trigger by running it immediately
mng schedule run my-trigger

# Remove a trigger
mng schedule remove my-trigger

# Remove multiple triggers without confirmation
mng schedule remove trigger-1 trigger-2 --force
```

## Subcommands

Run `mng schedule <subcommand> --help` for more details on each subcommand:

- **`add`** -- Create a new scheduled trigger
- **`remove`** -- Remove one or more scheduled triggers
- **`update`** -- Modify fields of an existing trigger
- **`list`** -- List scheduled triggers
- **`run`** -- Execute a trigger immediately for testing

## Packaging code for remote execution

In order to run `mng` commands in a scheduled environment like Modal, there are a few requirements:

1. The `mng` CLI needs to be available in the *Modal Function execution environment* (so that the command can run at all).
2. For the `create` command: the target project code that the agent will run (e.g. the repo that the agent will clone and work with) needs to either be available in the *Modal Function execution environment* (so that it can be injected into the agent) or automatically included via the command (ex: passing `--snapshot <snapshot-id>` to the `create` command).
3. The environment variables and files referred to by the command being run also need to be available in the *Modal Function execution environment* (so that the executed command runs as expected). 
4. The configuration for `mng` itself needs to be transferred into the *Modal Function execution environment* (so that the command executes as expected).

The `mng schedule` plugin takes care of #2 through #4 automatically, and ensures that #1 will happen correctly. 

### 1. Ensuring `mng` CLI availability for remote execution

The `mng schedule` plugin automatically ensures that the `mng` CLI is available in the execution environment.

The base image for the function is built from the `mng` Dockerfile, which already includes `mng` and all its dependencies.
The image is built in two stages:

1. **Base image (mng environment):** Built from the mng Dockerfile (bundled in the mng package at `imbue/mng/resources/Dockerfile`), which provides a complete environment with system deps, Python, uv, Claude Code, and mng installed. 
2. **Target repo layer:** The user's project is packaged as a tarball and extracted into the container at a configurable path (default `/code/project`, controlled by `--target-dir`). WORKDIR is set to this location.

### 2. Ensuring code availability for `create` commands

There are three modes for how the target repo is packaged:

1. **incremental** (default): on first deploy, the current HEAD commit hash is automatically resolved and cached in `~/.mng/build/<repo-hash>/commit_hash` so that subsequent deploys from the same repo reuse the same commit hash (delete the file to force re-resolution). This is an optimization to make deploys faster, since the project doesn't need to be repackaged and uploaded.
2. **full**: the entire current HEAD state of the repo (or just the whole folder, if not a git repo) is packaged and uploaded during the deploy. Pass `--full-copy` to enable this mode.
3. **snapshot**: [future] it should be possible to specify a snapshot id for commands, and thus not need to ship anything at all (this is not yet implemented)

#### Auto-merge at runtime

If working with a git repo, by default the scheduled function fetches and merges the latest code from the deployed branch before each run, so the agent always works with up-to-date code. 

This requires `GH_TOKEN` to be available in the deployed environment (via `--pass-env` or `--env-file`).

Use `--no-auto-merge` to disable this behavior, or `--auto-merge-branch <branch>` to merge from a specific branch (defaults to the current branch at deploy time).

### 3. Ensuring environment variable and file availability for remote execution

The `mng schedule` plugin automatically forwards any secrets and files that would be required by the scheduled create or start commands.

If the command is "message" or "exec", no files or environment variables are required.

### 4. Ensuring `mng` configuration availability for remote execution

The `mng schedule` plugin automatically syncs the relevant `mng` configuration for the scheduled command into the execution environment, so that the command runs as expected.
This includes much of the data in `~/.mng/` (except your own personal SSH keys, since those should never be transferred).

In order for you to be able to connect to the newly created agent, `mng schedule add` automatically adds an argument to include your SSH key as a known host for "create" and "start" commands.

## Developing

When developing this plugin (`mng schedule`, the mng monorepo is packaged and used as the build context to make an editable install.

The install mode is controlled by `--mng-install-mode` (default: `auto`, which auto-detects):

1. **package:** A modified version of the mng Dockerfile is generated that installs mng from PyPI via `uv pip install --system mng mng-schedule` instead of from source.
2. **editable:** The mng monorepo source is packaged and used as the Dockerfile build context. The Dockerfile extracts it, runs `uv sync`, and installs `mng` and `modal` as tools. This is a simple development workflow.
3. **skip:** As a special optimization when the target repo is *also* the `mng` monorepo, you can use the `--mng-install-mode skip` option to completely skip the packaging of the monorepo as a target repo, and simply point the target path at the mng code instead.
