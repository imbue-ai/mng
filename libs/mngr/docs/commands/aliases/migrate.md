# mngr migrate

**Synopsis:**

```text
mngr migrate <SOURCE_AGENT> [<AGENT_NAME>] [create-options...]
```

Move an agent to a different host by cloning it and destroying the original.

This is equivalent to running `mngr clone <source>` followed by
`mngr destroy --force <source>`. The first argument is the source agent to
migrate. An optional second positional argument sets the new agent's name.
All remaining arguments are passed through to the create command.

The source agent is always force-destroyed after a successful clone. If the
clone step fails, the source agent is left untouched. If the destroy step
fails after a successful clone, the error is reported and the user can
manually clean up.
