# Host Spec

## State

Most host data is queried from the provider (Docker, Modal, local, etc.) at runtime.

Some data (e.g. from plugins, events, logs, etc.) is stored in the host directory at `$MNGR_HOST_DIR/`.  By convention, it should include subdirectories for `logs/` and `events/`.

The host directory should also include a `env` file with the environment variables for agents running on the host.

Except for the contents of `data.json` (which is signed), data in the host directory is untrustworthy (since it can be modified by any process on the host).

### Reported fields

Note that this includes many of the underlying fields required for idle detection--there's no way to guarantee these, since, for example, an agent could always just slowly emit updates and keep updating the agent activity time.

**Important:** All access to host data should be through methods that communicate whether that data is "certified" or "reported", to help avoid confusion about which fields are trustworthy (ex: `get_provider` vs `get_reported_idle_mode`).
