# Thinking of something to fix

This skill provides guidelines for coming up with good ideas for things to fix.

## What types of things are good to fix?

The following are attributes of good fixes for you to tackle:
- The issue is obviously a problem (ex: a FIXME or TODO in the codebase, failing test, or something that is otherwise pretty clearly broken).
- It's better to fix existing functionality and clean things up than it is to add new features.
- The issue should be relatively small and easy to fix and self-contained (eg, not requiring a huge refactor or redesign of the system).
- There should be little ambiguity about whether this is something to fix, or how to fix it.
- Worst case, fixing style violations, adding additional tests, or updating outdated comments are always good options.
