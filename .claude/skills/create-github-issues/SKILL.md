# Creating GitHub Issues from Issue Files

This skill provides guidelines for converting issue files (created by the identify-* commands) into GitHub issues.

## Overview

Issue files are markdown files located in `_tasks/<category>/` directories within a library. Each file contains a list of identified issues (inconsistencies, style issues, outdated docstrings, etc.) that should be tracked as GitHub issues.

## Process

Follow these steps to convert an issue file into GitHub issues:

### 1. Find the Newly Created Issue File

Look for recently created markdown files in the library's `_tasks/` directory. The file will be in a subdirectory that indicates the issue category:

- `_tasks/inconsistencies/` - Code inconsistencies
- `_tasks/docs/` - Documentation and code disagreements
- `_tasks/style/` - Style guide violations
- `_tasks/docstrings/` - Outdated docstrings

### 2. Determine the Label

The label for GitHub issues should be based on the folder name under `_tasks/` where the issue file was created. For example:

- If the file is in `_tasks/docstrings/`, the label should be `docstrings`
- If the file is in `_tasks/inconsistencies/`, the label should be `inconsistencies`
- If the file is in `_tasks/style/`, the label should be `style`
- If the file is in `_tasks/docs/`, the label should be `docs`

### 3. Load All Open GitHub Issues with This Label

Query GitHub for all open issues with this label using:

```bash
gh issue list --label "<label>" --state open --json number,title,body,state --limit 1000
```

This returns all open issues with the specified label so you can avoid creating duplicates.

### 4. Create New GitHub Issues

For each issue in the file that does not already exist in GitHub:

1. Parse the issue from the markdown file (each issue is typically a numbered section like `## 1. <title>`)
2. Check if a similar issue already exists by comparing titles and descriptions
3. If no matching issue exists, create a new one:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<Short description>" --body "<Full issue content>" --label "<label>" --label "autoclaude"
```

**Important:** Always include the `autoclaude` label when creating new issues. This label identifies issues that were automatically created by Claude and helps with downstream processing (e.g., converting triaged issues to FIXMEs).

The body should include all data from the issue file, including:
- The full description of the issue
- File names and line numbers where applicable
- The recommendation for how to fix it
- etc.

### 5. Update Existing Issues

For any issues that already exist in GitHub but have new data or details in the file:

```bash
gh issue edit <issue_number> --title "<Updated description>" --body "<Updated body content>"
```

Only update if there is meaningful new information to add.

### 6. Refresh the Issue List

After creating and updating issues, query GitHub again to get a consolidated view:

```bash
gh issue list --label "<label>" --state open --json number,title,body,createdAt --limit 1000
```

### 7. Rank Issues by Importance

Review all open issues with this label and create your own ranking from most important to least important. Consider:

- Impact (how important it is to fix the issue, how confusing the current state is, etc.). Higher impact = more important
- Certainty (how likely this issue is to actually be a problem). Higher certainty = more important
- Effort required to fix. Lower effort = more important

Make an explicit ranked list of issue numbers in order from the most important to the least important by writing the issue numbers to a file (ranked_issue_list.txt) in order from most important to least important, one per line.

### 8. Prune Excess Issues

If there are more than 50 open issues with this label, delete the least important ones until only 50 remain:

```bash
tail -n +51 ranked_issue_list.txt | xargs -I {} gh issue delete {} --yes
```

### 9. Update Timestamps for Sorting

In reverse order (from least important to most important), update each open issue by adding and then removing the "updated" label. This will cause them to sort properly when viewing by "recently updated".

This can be done by running the following commands:

```bash
head -n 50 ranked_issue_list.txt > reversed_issue_list.txt
tac reversed_issue_list.txt | xargs -I {} gh issue --add-label updated
tac reversed_issue_list.txt | xargs -I {} gh issue --remove-label updated
```

## Notes

- The issue file formats vary slightly between different identify-* commands, but all follow a similar pattern with numbered sections
- Always check for duplicates before creating new issues
- Use your judgment when determining if an existing issue should be updated vs. left as-is
- The 50-issue limit per label helps keep the issue backlog manageable
